    "raw": "\nTRPC (Transport RPC) is a modern, lightweight RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework for building scalable and maintainable APIs in Node.js. In this blog, we will discuss TRPC and its features.\n\n## What is TRPC?\nTRPC is an open-source, TypeScript-first RPC framework that simplifies the process of building scalable and maintainable APIs. TRPC provides a set of tools and conventions for building APIs that can be used in both server-side and client-side applications.\n\n## Features of TRPC\n\nTypeScript support: TRPC is built with TypeScript and provides first-class support for TypeScript. This means that developers can write type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process.\n\nSimple API definition: TRPC provides a simple and intuitive API definition that allows developers to define API endpoints and their input and output types.\n\nScalable architecture: TRPC provides a scalable architecture that can be used to build large-scale APIs. It supports features such as batching, pagination, and caching.\n\nClient-side support: TRPC provides client-side support that makes it easy to consume APIs from client-side applications. It supports a wide range of client-side frameworks, including React, Angular, and Vue.\n\nSecurity: TRPC provides built-in support for secure APIs. It supports features such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n## Benefits of using TRPC\n\nReduced development time: TRPC simplifies the process of building APIs by providing a set of tools and conventions. This can significantly reduce development time and improve developer productivity.\n\nImproved code quality: TRPC provides type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process. This improves code quality and reduces the likelihood of bugs and errors.\n\nScalable architecture: TRPC provides a scalable architecture that can be used to build large-scale APIs. This ensures that the API can handle a high volume of requests and can scale as the application grows.\n\nSimplified client-side integration: TRPC provides client-side support that makes it easy to consume APIs from client-side applications. This simplifies client-side integration and reduces the complexity of the application.\n\nSecure APIs: TRPC provides built-in support for secure APIs. This ensures that the API is secure and protects against common security threats such as authentication and authorization.\n\n## Conclusion\nTRPC is a modern, lightweight RPC framework for building scalable and maintainable APIs. Its TypeScript support, simple API definition, scalable architecture, client-side support, and security features make it a popular choice for building APIs in Node.js. TRPC simplifies the process of building APIs, reduces development time, and improves code quality.\n## see you on next blog ✌️",
