Here, we’ll explore 12 essential Web APIs, explain their functionality, and provide code examples to help you implement them in your projects.\n![tRPC logo](https://i.ibb.co/kD896dz/api-portada.jpg)\n\n## 1. Storage API\n\nThe Web Storage API (including `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`) allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser. It's useful for saving user preferences or persisting data between sessions.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\n// Save data to localStorage\nlocalStorage.setItem('userName', 'Vishal')\n\n// Retrieve data from localStorage\nconst user = localStorage.getItem('userName')\n\n// Clear localStorage\nlocalStorage.removeItem('userName')\n```\n\n[Learn More about Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Payment Request API\n\nThe Payment Request API simplifies the process of accepting payments on the web by providing a consistent user experience across various payment methods.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nif (window.PaymentRequest) {\n  const payment = new PaymentRequest(\n    [\n      {\n        supportedMethods: 'basic-card',\n      },\n    ],\n    {\n      total: { label: 'Total', amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '10.00' } },\n    }\n  )\n\n  payment\n    .show()\n    .then((result) => {\n      // Process payment result\n      console.log(result)\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n      console.error('Payment failed:', error)\n    })\n}\n```\n\n[Learn More about Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API)\n\n---\n\n## 3. DOM API\n\nThe DOM (Document Object Model) API allows you to manipulate the structure, style, and content of the document. This is one of the most widely used APIs in web development.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\n// Select and update an element\nconst element = document.querySelector('#myElement')\nelement.textContent = 'Hello, World!'\n```\n\n[Learn More about DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)\n\n---\n\n## 4. HTML Sanitizer API\n\nThe HTML Sanitizer API helps clean up untrusted HTML content to avoid security risks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst dirtyHTML = '<img src=\"javascript:alert(1)\">'\nconst cleanHTML = sanitizer.sanitize(dirtyHTML)\nconsole.log(cleanHTML) // Safe HTML output\n```\n\n[Learn More about HTML Sanitizer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Sanitizer_API)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Canvas API\n\nThe Canvas API allows you to draw graphics and animations on a web page using the `<canvas>` element, perfect for creating games, visualizations, or custom graphics.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas')\nconst context = canvas.getContext('2d')\ncontext.fillStyle = 'blue'\ncontext.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100)\n```\n\n[Learn More about Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)\n\n---\n\n## 6. History API\n\nThe History API lets you interact with the browser’s session history, allowing you to manipulate the browser's history stack (e.g., `pushState`, `replaceState`).\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nhistory.pushState({ page: 1 }, 'title', '/page1')\nhistory.replaceState({ page: 2 }, 'title', '/page2')\n```\n\n[Learn More about History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Clipboard API\n\nThe Clipboard API allows you to read from and write to the clipboard, enabling features like copy-paste functionality.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.clipboard\n  .writeText('Hello, Clipboard!')\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log('Text copied to clipboard')\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.error('Failed to copy text:', err)\n  })\n```\n\n[Learn More about Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Fullscreen API\n\nThe Fullscreen API allows you to present a specific element or the entire webpage in fullscreen mode, useful for videos or immersive experiences like games.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\ndocument\n  .getElementById('myElement')\n  .requestFullscreen()\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.error(`Error attempting to enable full-screen mode: ${err.message}`)\n  })\n```\n\n[Learn More about Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API)\n\n---\n\n## 9. FormData API\n\nThe FormData API simplifies the process of constructing key/value pairs representing form fields and their values for easier form data submission via XHR or Fetch.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst form = document.querySelector('form')\nconst formData = new FormData(form)\nfetch('/submit', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: formData,\n}).then((response) => {\n  if (response.ok) {\n    console.log('Form submitted successfully!')\n  }\n})\n```\n\n[Learn More about FormData API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData_API)\n\n---\n\n## 10. Fetch API\n\nThe Fetch API provides a modern and flexible way to make asynchronous network requests, offering a simpler, promise-based alternative to `XMLHttpRequest`.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nfetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n  .then((response) => response.json())\n  .then((data) => console.log(data))\n  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error))\n```\n\n[Learn More about Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)\n\n---\n\n## 11. Drag and Drop API\n\nThe Drag and Drop API allows you to implement drag-and-drop functionality in your web applications, enhancing user interactions with intuitive UI elements.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst item = document.getElementById('item')\nitem.addEventListener('dragstart', (e) => {\n  e.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', item.id)\n})\n```\n\n[Learn More about Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)\n\n---\n\n## 12. Geolocation API\n\nThe Geolocation API provides access to geographical location information from the user’s device, enabling location-based services and features.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```javascript\nnavigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(\n  (position) => {\n    console.log(`Latitude: ${position.coords.latitude}, Longitude: ${position.coords.longitude}`)\n  },\n  (error) => {\n    console.error(`Error getting location: ${error.message}`)\n  }\n)\n```\n\n[Learn More about Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese Web APIs open up a world of possibilities for creating highly interactive, user-friendly web applications.

It was developed by Microsoft and provides additional features and tools to make it easier to build large-scale, complex applications. In this blog, we will discuss TypeScript and its features.\n![tRPC logo](https://i.ibb.co/yYNBJSX/Web-capture-17-5-2023-21537-www-google-com.jpg)\n\n## What is TypeScript?\n\nTypeScript is a statically typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was first released in 2012 by Microsoft and has since gained popularity in the web development community. TypeScript provides additional features and tools that are not available in JavaScript, such as static typing, interfaces, and classes.\n\n## Features of TypeScript\n\nStatic typing: TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that variables are checked for type errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This helps to catch errors early in the development process and makes the code more reliable.\n\nInterfaces: TypeScript supports interfaces, which define a set of properties and methods that an object must have. This helps to enforce type safety and provides a way to define complex types.\n\nClasses: TypeScript supports classes, which provide a way to define object-oriented programming constructs such as inheritance and encapsulation. This makes it easier to organize and manage code in large-scale applications.\n\nType annotations: TypeScript supports type annotations, which provide a way to specify the type of a variable or function parameter. This helps to enforce type safety and makes the code more self-documenting.\n\nBetter tooling: TypeScript provides better tooling than JavaScript, such as code completion, code navigation, and refactoring. This makes it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.\n\n## Benefits of using TypeScript\n\nImproved type safety: TypeScript provides a way to catch type errors early in the development process, which makes the code more reliable and easier to maintain.\n\nBetter IDE support: TypeScript provides better IDE support than JavaScript, which makes it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.\n\nImproved code organization: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming constructs such as classes and interfaces, which makes it easier to organize and manage code in large-scale applications.\n\nBetter documentation: TypeScript provides type annotations, which make the code more self-documenting and easier to understand.\n\nEasier adoption: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that developers who are familiar with JavaScript can easily adopt TypeScript without having to learn a new language.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTypeScript is a powerful programming language that provides additional features and tools to make it easier to build large-scale, complex applications. Its static typing, interfaces, classes, and type annotations make the code more reliable and easier to maintain. TypeScript provides better IDE support than JavaScript and makes it easier to organize and manage code in large-scale applications.\n\n## see you on next blog ✌️\n",
