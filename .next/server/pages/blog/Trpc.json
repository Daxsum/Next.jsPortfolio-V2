In this blog, we will discuss tRPC and its features.\n![tRPC logo](https://i.ibb.co/0rG8LgJ/Web-capture-17-5-2023-15215-www-google-com.jpg)\n## What is tRPC?\ntRPC is an open-source, TypeScript-first RPC framework that simplifies the process of building scalable and maintainable APIs. tRPC provides a set of tools and conventions for building APIs that can be used in both server-side and client-side applications.\n\n## Features of tRPC\n\nTypeScript support: tRPC is built with TypeScript and provides first-class support for TypeScript. This means that we can write type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process.\n\nSimple API definition: tRPC provides a simple and intuitive API definition that allow us to define API endpoints and their input and output types.\n\nScalable architecture: tRPC provides a scalable architecture that can be used to build large-scale APIs. It supports features such as batching, pagination, and caching.\n\nClient-side support: tRPC provides client-side support that makes it easy to consume APIs from client-side applications. It supports a wide range of client-side frameworks, including React, Angular, and Vue.\n\nSecurity: tRPC provides built-in support for secure APIs. It supports features such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n## Benefits of using tRPC\n\nReduced development time: tRPC simplifies the process of building APIs by providing a set of tools and conventions. This can significantly reduce development time and improve our productivity.\n\nImproved code quality: tRPC provides type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process. This improves code quality and reduces the likelihood of bugs and errors.\n\nScalable architecture: tRPC provides a scalable architecture that can be used to build large-scale APIs. This ensures that the API can handle a high volume of requests and can scale as the application grows.\n\nSimplified client-side integration: tRPC provides client-side support that makes it easy to consume APIs from client-side applications. This simplifies client-side integration and reduces the complexity of the application.\n\nSecure APIs: tRPC provides built-in support for secure APIs. This ensures that the API is secure and protects against common security threats such as authentication and authorization.\n\n## Conclusion\ntRPC is a modern, lightweight RPC framework for building scalable and maintainable APIs. Its TypeScript support, simple API definition, scalable architecture, client-side support, and security features make it a popular choice for building APIs in Node.js. tRPC simplifies the process of building APIs, reduces development time, and improves code quality.\n## see you on next blog ✌️","code":"var Component=(()=>{var l=Object.create;var r=Object.defineProperty;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var h=Object.getPrototypeOf,m=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var f=(t,s)=>()=>(s||t((s={exports:{}}).exports,s),s.exports),g=(t,s)=>{for(var n in s)r(t,n,{get:s[n],enumerable:!0})},o=(t,s,n,i)=>{if(s&&typeof s==\"object\"||typeof s==\"function\")for(let a of u(s))!m.call(t,a)&&a!==n&&r(t,a,{get:()=>s[a],enumerable:!(i=p(s,a))||i.enumerable});return t};var P=(t,s,n)=>(n=t!=null?l(h(t)):{},o(s||!t||!t.__esModule?r(n,\"default\",{value:t,enumerable:!0}):n,t)),b=t=>o(r({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),t);var d=f((w,c)=>{c.exports=_jsx_runtime});var v={};g(v,{default:()=>R,frontmatter:()=>I});var e=P(d()),I={title:\"tRPC (Transport RPC)First Impression\",date:new Date(1672416e6),lastmod:\"2022-12-30\",tags:[\"Review\"],draft:!1,summary:\"tRPC simplifies the process of building APIs\"};function C(t={}){let{wrapper:s}=t.components||{};return s?(0,e.jsx)(s,Object.assign({},t,{children:(0,e.jsx)(n,{})})):n();function n(){let i=Object.assign({p:\"p\",img:\"img\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",span:\"span\"},t.components);return(0,e.jsxs)(e.Fragment,{children:[(0,e.jsxs)(i.p,{children:[\"tRPC (transport RPC) is a modern, lightweight RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework for building scalable and maintainable APIs in Node.js.
