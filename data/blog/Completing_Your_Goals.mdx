Recently, I was watching a YouTube video about something. In that video, I heard a story about a fox and Swearah Honey, which caught my attention. I will explain what caught my attention in a moment. First, let me summarize the story briefly to give you an idea at first glance.
![Fox image](https://www.massaudubon.org/var/site/storage/images/1/1/9/9/1659911-1-eng-US/9e6b1b96a456-5457Jenny_Zhao44790-1920x1280-2-.jpg)

In the jungle, there was a hungry fox searching for food, hunting and chasing to find it after sacrificing much time and effort. Eventually, it discovered a sweet honey hidden in a hole in the ground. When it saw the honey, it felt like it had won. The fox jumped with joy and ran excitedly to get it. However, after that moment of happiness, when it returned to the sweet honey, it found that it was already gone, taken by people. The fox could not believe what it saw and was devastated.

After a week, the fox hunted again and found another sweet honey hole underground, just like before. This time, it remembered what had happened previously. It approached the sweet honey using its two front legs while keeping the honey secure with its other two legs.

This is the story in short. You might think it sounds childish, but I assure you it is not. What caught my attention is that I found myself in this story. About four to five years ago, when I first started working after finishing 12th grade, I struggled with many positive and negative experiences that held me back. One of my struggles was early happiness.

What I mean by that is when I developed a good plan and took action toward it, I would become happy and excited even if there was still a little work remaining to complete the plan. Because of this, I missed many opportunities, just like the fox did. However, I learned how to finish tasks, albeit the hard way, through losing chances and more.

I realized the importance of sharing this notion with you because it might help someone avoid missing a chance they may regret in the future. My message is to learn how to finish your work.

One last message for software engineers like me: please finish your projects in the GitHub repository before it's too late.

Thank you for your patience. Let me know your comments down below.

## I will catch you in the next one. Ciao.✌️
